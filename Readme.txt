1. How to run the application

Build/HomeAssignment.exe is a release build.
In the same folder, there is a config.xml file. It contains all the information about bundles, products and rules.


The application was written with Visual Studio:

Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 
Version 15.8.4

Microsoft .NET Framework
Version 4.7.03056


The project should compile and run without any additional setup. 
HomeAssignment/config.xml is copied automatically to the output directory. If you want to modify bundles or products, that is the file you need to modify.



2. How to run the tests of the application

For unit tests, I used Visual Studio Unit Testing Framework (MSTest). To run the tests you need to open Visual Studio, open Test Explorer window and click on "Run All". Alternatively, you can use a keyboard shortcut CTRL+R,A. Also, you can go to menu Test->Run->All Tests. If you don't see the Test Explorer window, go to menu Test->Windows->Test Explorer (shortcut CTRL+E,T).
